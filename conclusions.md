# Conclusions

While [Taxonworks has an equivalent model](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/scratchpads-usage/taxonworks-mappings.html) for most core content types, not all fields are supported (particularly in the case of [custom fields](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/scratchpads-usage/fields.html)), and [custom node types](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/scratchpads-usage/node-count.html) will be particularly tricky to map. Taxonworks also does not provide any storage for UI content such as pages, which are [widely used](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/scratchpads-usage/node-breakdown.html) across Scratchpads.

Taxonworks could be a good fit for a small number of sites that are used primarily for data management, however the complexity and variety of Scratchpads data means using Taxonworks as a one-size-fits-all solution will be prohibitively complicated.
